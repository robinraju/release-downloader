A Github Action to download assets from Github release. It can download
specified files from both private and public repositories.

## Usage

```yaml
- uses: robinraju/release-downloader@v1
  with:
    # The source repository path.
    # Expected format {owner}/{repo}
    # Default: ${{ github.repository }}
    repository: ''

    # A flag to set the download target as latest release
    # The default value is 'false'
    latest: true

    # A flag to download from prerelease. It should be combined with latest flag.
    # The default value is 'false'
    preRelease: true

    # The github tag. e.g: v1.0.1
    # Download assets from a specific tag/version
    tag: ''

    # The release id to download files from
    releaseId: ''

    # The name of the file to download.
    # Use this field only to specify filenames other than tarball or zipball, if any.
    # Supports wildcard pattern (eg: '*', '*.deb', '*.zip' etc..)
    fileName: ''

    # Download the attached tarball (*.tar.gz)
    tarBall: true

    # Download the attached zipball (*.zip)
    zipBall: true

    # Relative path under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE to place the downloaded file(s)
    # It will create the target directory automatically if not present, defaults to root directory
    # eg: out-file-path: "my-downloads" => It will create directory $GITHUB_WORKSPACE/my-downloads
    out-file-path: ''

    # A flag to set if the downloaded assets are archives and should be extracted
    # Checks all downloaded files if they end with zip, tar or tar.gz and extracts them, if true.
    # Prints a warning if enabled but file is not an archive - but does not fail.
    extract: false

    # Relative path under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE to extract the downloaded file(s) if extract flag is set
    # Checks all downloaded files if they end with zip, tar or tar.gz and extracts them to this path if specified.
    # If not set it points to "out-file-path" directory.
    # eg: extract-path: "my-downloads" => It will create directory $GITHUB_WORKSPACE/my-downloads
    extract-path: ''

    # Github access token to download files from private repositories
    # https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets
    # eg: token: ${{ secrets.MY_TOKEN }}
    token: ''

    # The URL of the Github API, only use this input if you are using Github Enterprise
    # Default: "https://api.github.com"
    # Use http(s)://[hostname]/api/v3 to access the API for GitHub Enterprise Server
    github-api-url: ''
